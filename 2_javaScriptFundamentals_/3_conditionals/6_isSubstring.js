/**
 * IndexOf()
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Now lets give you a little challenge with the String.indexOf() method. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Write a function isSubstring that takes in two strings, searchString and subString. The function should return true if subString is a part of thesearchString, regardless of upper or lower case, and false if otherwise.
 * 
 * If any of this is too confusing, know that's normal. We'll dig into String.indexOf() more further in the curriculum. Give yourself 30-60 minutes to Google and see if you can discover the answer.
